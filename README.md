A form used for finalizing and reporting on job orders, comparing estimated and actual costs and durations, and calculating discrepancies to provide a comprehensive end-of-job evaluation.

This form consists of three sections. 
1- The first section compares the estimated and actual total costs, durations, and materials, using the job order as a reference.

2-Next, it goes through an initial approval. Here, the information of the individuals who entered and approved the job order is displayed.

After this final check is either approved or rejected (the manager must press either approve or reject), a yellow button to view the report appears for the manager. This report shows the mathematical calculation of the estimated and actual costs and durations, as compared in the first section, and provides a profit and loss analysis.

Of course, all of this is done with reference to the job order number. The job order number is what facilitates the communication between the tables.
